                As the final project for CSCE 240 (Advanced Programming Techniques), we had to create a chatbot that reads data from both CDC and WebMD and uses said data to answer questions provided by the user. We first worked on our own version of the chatbot by ourselves so that we could learn how to program more efficiently. The final version of my solo chatbot can be found <a class="aBody" href="https://github.com/JamelChouarfia/CSCE240H-Spring2023-Jamel">here</a>.
                <br><br>For the team portion of the project, we had to figure out which parts of the individual chatbots that we made should be used in our final chatbot. Each person was assigned a part of the chatbot and they were required to figure out which chatbot had the best code for their part. My role was to be a leader and give guidance on questions that the team had. We had an idea of which parts would be the best to combine, but I decided that the best course of action would just to have a base to work on and add features to it. We chose to use cfsteege's program as the base since it was well written, modular, and had a GUI. We added features to it and presented it to our teacher as a final exam, receiving a 100.
